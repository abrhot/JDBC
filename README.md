JDBC Connection Example
This project demonstrates how to establish a connection between a Java application and a MySQL database using the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API.

Features
Establishes a connection to a MySQL database.
Performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Illustrates proper resource management with try-with-resources.
Provides a modular and reusable structure for database interactions.
Requirements
Java JDK: Version 8 or later.
MySQL Database: Installed and running.
JDBC Driver: Ensure the MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver) is added to the project's classpath.
Setup
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/jdbc-connection-example.git
Set up a MySQL database:

Create a database and a table.
Update the database credentials in the code.
Add the JDBC driver to your project:

Download MySQL Connector/J.
Add it to your project's classpath.
Usage
Update the database configuration in the Java file:
java
Copy code
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
String user = "your_username";
String password = "your_password";
Compile the project:
bash
Copy code
javac -cp .:path-to-mysql-connector.jar YourJavaFile.java
Run the project:
bash
Copy code
java -cp .:path-to-mysql-connector.jar YourJavaFile
Code Highlights
Database Connection:

java
Copy code
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
Executing Queries:

java
Copy code
String query = "SELECT * FROM your_table";
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);
Closing Resources:

java
Copy code
try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)) {
    // Database operations
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
